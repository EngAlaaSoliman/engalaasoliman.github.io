This is the final post for my Outreachy internship! It’s amazing how far I’ve come these past 3 months. I’ve been exposed to new technologies, new ideas, a new level of confidence and I’ve met some really wonderful people. In this post, I’ll be sharing my general experience throughout the period.

From fears at the start of my internship to learning a lot of things. My mentors helped me a lot ,They guided me through a pattern till I realized what to do also provided useful resources and gave me thier feedback .

The most amazing thing about this internship for me, was how it got me out of that shell. I met problems I had no idea about, but I actually ended up fixing! That’s huge that is for me! I was determined to understand what I was to do.

This internship has helped me understand from a high level how things are connected, what my code is actually doing.First, I learnt how to write shell script and how to write selftests. 

I worked on continuing work on created a library to cut down on duplication and make writing selftests somewhat enjoyable. I have done the most of this library and wrote some examples on how to use it ,and i have been working on enhancement of the library.

Finally, I plan on continuing contributing to Linux Kernel as i enjoyed it and have been learning a lot of things. I think what Outreachy is doing is so amazing and I’m glad to be a part of it. I’m also extremely grateful to my mentors and the open source community.
