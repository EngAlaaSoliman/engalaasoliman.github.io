## Starting as an Linux Kernel Intern

I was accepted for the May 2022 to August 2022 Outreachy internship round, You have been selected as an intern for Linux Kernel working on the project "Linux kernel Networking API and selftest improvements".
This is Alaa. I graduated as an Electronics and Communication Engineering Bachelor degree and have a good experince in C/C++ and have  good knowledge about linux kernel.

Talking about my core values; Among the many things or treats important to me, I think that three core values are development, Patience, and Perseverance.
I am always striving to enhance myself and my capabilities. I seek to develop my mind and my knowledge. I want to spot my weaknesses and convert them to the absolute opposite. I am curious about many things, and I want to widen my knowledge about those things and to develop.

When everything around us is changing, when the world is difficult to understand ,our core values will always be there for us. I believe in patience ,yes I agree Patience is bitter but I also agree its fruit is sweet.
Perseverance, major character trait for one to be successful in life here I like to add my favorite quote "The only guarantee for failure is to stop trying".
Situations in our lives keep on changing constantly and quite unexpectedly too. The ability to accept what you control and what you can't control is required in life.

These and other core values such as being ambitious directed me to applying to the Outreachy Internship! I want to develop my skills and to sharpen my knowledge.
I believe Outreachy is not an ordinary internship, where you just work with your mentors. It is a community of interesting people, who respect each other, other peopleâ€™s values, and of course have a strong passion for coding. I am very happy to be a part of it. 
To me, Outreachy seemed like an awesome opportunity to exercise somehow those values, while getting closer to other topics that are key to me: inclusion and diversity. From a more personal perspective, it also meant having the chance to study and get back on track with my developer skills, in order to improve my chances of finding a good, meaningful job, while doing cool stuff, with hopefully cool and interesting people. As I believe in sharing, I also understand the importance of free software.
